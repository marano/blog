## First of all

To start with this post, make sure you have Package Control installed and if you haven't don't worry, it's pretty easy to install, just follow this [link](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).

After installed you need to be familiarized with this command: `CMD` (or `CTRL` in case you are a Windows user) + `Shift` + `P`. With this you`ll be able to search and install all packages that I'll show here.

Now each headline means the name of the package. So when you hit the command above, press `Enter` and type one of the dotted headlines names.

## ● Color Highlighter

Hexadecimals are a lil' bit hard to memorize, so how about click and see what color is? That's exactly what Color Highlighter do.

This also works for pre-processors variables and note that the colors will be always underlined either.

## ● Sidebar Enhancements

The default sidebar actions of ST are kinda poor. You can't even move a file to another folder! To solve that, install this plugin and a lot of options will show up when you make a right click.

## ● Emmet

Emmet is a toolkit to improve HTML & CSS. In other words you can do almost anything in a half of time (and lines).

To create this default HTML5 strucutre I just type `!` and hit tab. These itens inside the body I did `h3+ul.menu>li*5>a` which gave us a headline, an unordered list named menu with 5 list items and a link in each one.

## ● Emmet Css Snippets

This plugin is to boost up the previous one. A bunch of abbreviations that Emmet is missing you can find here (like pseudo properties for example).

## ● Syntax Support

Sublime Text doesn't have all the syntaxes over the web. In my case I need to work with `Ruby Slim` and `Sass` so if you need to edit a file and the colors are not matching the colorscheme, probably it's because you have to install it.

## Extras

Further than packages, Sublime has cool and useful shortcuts like sort lines alphabetically just selecting them and pressing `F5`.

Or maybe select and replace multiple lines... (`CMD + D`)

![Multiple lines](/blog/images/posts/2015-03-09/multiple-lines.gif)

You can also setup the preferences the way you want (like change a colorscheme, increase font size and do not open new files in a new window) just editing the menu `preferences > settings - user`.

These are just a few things that Sublime Text can do for you. More information about packages and themes you can find in [this link](https://packagecontrol.io/browse).
