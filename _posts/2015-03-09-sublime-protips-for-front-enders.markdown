## First of all

To start with this post, make sure you have Package Control installed and if you haven't don't worry, it's pretty easy to install, just follow this [link](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).

After installed you need to be familiarized with this command: `CMD` (or `CTRL` in case you are a Windows user) + `Shift` + `P`. With this you`ll be able to search and install all packages that I'll show here.

Now each headline means the name of the package. So when you do the command above, press `Enter` and type one of the headlines names.

## Color Highlighter

Hexadecimals are a lil' bit hard to memorize, so how about click and see what color is? That's exactly what Color Highlighter do.

## Sidebar Enhancements

The default sidebar actions of ST are kinda poor. You can't even move a file to another folder! To solve that, install this plugin and a lot of options will show up when you make a right click.
