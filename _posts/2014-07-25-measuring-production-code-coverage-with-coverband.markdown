Here at HE:labs we strive for 100% code coverage on our projects from day one when
[starting new projects](https://github.com/Helabs/pah), but that doesn't mean that
the code we write are actually being used on production by real users. For sure we
can get some insights by looking at analytics data, figuring out which pages are
being accessed and things like that but this data won't tell us which code paths
are actually being executed. That's where [coverband](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband)
comes in.

Coverband is an awesome gem built by [Dan Mayer](http://mayerdan.com/) that had its
initial release back in [December 2013](https://techblog.livingsocial.com/blog/2013/12/17/coverband-production-ruby-code-coverage/)
and just reached maturity with a 1.0.0 release [last sunday](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband/commit/c7edb6895e143150d96f514f73011547918e308c).

From its README:

> It can be used as Rack middleware, wrapping a block with sampling, or manually
configured to meet any need (like coverage on background jobs).

What caught my attention when I first found out about the gem what [this section](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband#success)
from the project's README as well:

> After running in production for 30 minutes, we were able very easily delete 2000
LOC after looking through the data. We expect to be able to clean up much more after
it has collected more data.

In my opinion, that's an impressive mark for such a small sampling and I got really
curious to understand how well the gem would behave on the wild. Last week I got
my hands dirty and on this post I'll go through the process of setting things up
for collecting production coverage from Ruby on Rails apps that are deployed to
Heroku and also what kind of information those numbers can give us.

-----------------

[sample Rails app](https://github.com/fgrehm/legacy-blog-app)

No examples on how to use it with a heroku app

ABOUT THE APP

used pah to generate the app

example: legacy blog app, added support for categories and comments and later removed (just the links and the code that displays it on the page)

from readme, after 30 minutes on prod, removed around 2k lines of code

-------------------
SETUP

data will be stored on redis
add to gemfile, bundle install

FROM GEM'S README

  After installing the gem. There are a few steps to gather data, view reports, and for cleaning up the data.

  First configure cover band options using the config file, See the section below
  Then configure Rake, with helpful tasks. Make sure things are working by recording your Coverband baseline. See the section below
  Setup the rack middleware, the middleware is what makes Coverband gather metrics when your app runs. See below for details
  I setup Coverband in my rackup config.ru you can also set it up in rails middleware, but it may miss recording some code coverage early in the rails process. It does improve performance to have it later in the middleware stack. So there is a tradeoff there.
  To debug in development mode, I recommend turning verbose logging on config.verbose = true and passing in the Rails.logger config.logger = Rails.logger to the Coverband config. This makes it easy to follow in development mode. Be careful to not leave these on in production as they will effect performance.
  Start your server with rackup config.ru If you use rails s make sure it is using your config.ru or Coverband won't be recording any data.
  Hit your development server exercising the endpoints you want to verify Coverband is recording.
  Now to view changes in live coverage run rake coverband:coverage again, previously it should have only shown the baseline data of your app initializing. After using it in development it should show increased coverage from the actions you have exercised.

[rake task to collect data from heroku](LINK)

heroku addons:add redistogo

https://github.com/danmayer/coverband/issues/3

deployed to heroku

prerelease / new 1.0.0 on the way

make sure it clears data on deploy

report has to be generated with the same revision as the prod version

-----------------------------------


looking at the results

run rake task

* using slim it considers part of the template as not covered (even though it gets rendered, link to stuff on erb)
* lots of lines not taken into consideration
* TODO: check if unused associations will be picked up
* models that are not in use will be hard to spot unless they have some custom logic that is not going to be hit and will lower its coverage
* coverband VS rails assets
* redis free addon limitations (no backup, storage capacity....)

Generate coverage from the heroku app

figure out the performance impact on a real app
