Here at HE:labs we strive for [100% code coverage](https://github.com/Helabs/pah/blob/master/lib/pah/files/spec/spec_helper.rb#L3-L5)
on our projects [from day one](https://github.com/Helabs/pah#pah), but that
doesn't mean that all the code we write are actually being used on production by
real users. For sure we can get some insights by looking at analytics data,
figuring out which pages are being accessed and things like that but this data
won't tell us which code paths are actually being executed. That's where [Coverband](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband)
comes in.

<!--more-->

Coverband is an awesome gem built by [Dan Mayer](http://mayerdan.com/) that had its
initial release back in [December 2013](https://techblog.livingsocial.com/blog/2013/12/17/coverband-production-ruby-code-coverage/)
and just reached maturity with a [1.0.0 release](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband/commit/c7edb6895e143150d96f514f73011547918e308c).

From its README:

> It can be used as Rack middleware, wrapping a block with sampling, or manually
configured to meet any need (like coverage on background jobs).

What caught my attention when I first found out about the gem was [this section](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband#success)
from the project's README:

> After running in production for 30 minutes, we were able very easily delete 2000
LOC after looking through the data. We expect to be able to clean up much more after
it has collected more data.

In my opinion, that's an impressive mark for such a small sampling and I got really
curious to understand how well the gem would behave on the wild. Last week I started
getting my hands dirty and on this post I'll go through the process of setting
things up for collecting production coverage from Ruby on Rails apps that are
deployed to Heroku and also what kind of information we can get out of it.

## Le application

In order to keep things simple, I laid out a "[legacy blog application](https://github.com/fgrehm/legacy-blog-app)"
that has a few characteristics we are likely to find on old Ruby on Rails apps out
in the wild.

Imagine that the app has a good code coverage (_just so you know it doesn't_), has
been running on production for a few years and lots of things have changed along
the way. The team initially implemented support for assigning categories to blog
posts, allowed editing / removing comments and also highlighting posts for an
old "Featured" section. But, the product team has decided that all of those features
 were not needed and the team didn't take enough care to remove all the code
related to make them work.

Now imagine that the company behind that app decided to hire the consultancy shop
you work for to improve the system and you've been assigned to the project. How
will you know what is actually being used? On this contrived example it is pretty
simple to spot but on a real world medium / large sized Rails application it probably
won't ;)

## Setting up Coverband for our app

The coverage data will be stored on [redis](http://redis.io/) so make sure you
have it running on your machine to try things out and also on the production
environment so you can collect the data. For my tests, I chose to use the
[Redis To Go](https://addons.heroku.com/redistogo) Heroku addon on its free plan.

With redis in place, we can then add the gem reference to our `Gemfile` and
`bundle install` it:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# We don't need Coverband on the test env, so we'll just require it when needed
gem 'coverband', '1.0.0', require: false
{% endhighlight %}

After installing the gem, there are a few things we need to do before collecting
data and generating reports.

First we'll have to configure Coverband options using its [config file](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband#configure-coverband-options).
There are a few options we can set but the ones I found out to be the most important
ones are described on the [config provided with the legacy blog app](https://github.com/fgrehm/legacy-blog-app/blob/master/config/coverband.rb).
For the purpose of my experiments I've set up the most "aggressive" settings but
on a real app you will probaly use a more "conservative" approach or you'll
experience some significant performance issues.

Then you have to configure some [Rake tasks](https://github.com/fgrehm/legacy-blog-app/blob/master/lib/tasks/coverband.rake#L1-L5).
You can test that things are working by running a `rake coverband:baseline` and
a `rake coverband:coverage`. If all goes well you should see a code coverage
report at your `coverage/index.html` with information about your application
initialization process.

Last but not least, we have to set up the [rack middleware](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband#configure-rack-middleware)
on our [config.ru](https://github.com/fgrehm/legacy-blog-app/blob/master/config.ru#L5-L7).
The middleware is what makes Coverband collect metrics when our app runs.

Those settings should be enough to start collecting data about our app, so fire
up a server with `rails server`, exercise the endpoints you want to verify
Coverband is recording and run `rake coverband:coverage` again. Previously it
should have only shown the baseline data of our app initializing and after using
it in development the report should show increased coverage from the actions we
have exercised.

## Setting things up for Heroku

Right now there are no examples on how to use Coverband on Heroku, the only thing
I could find was [this issue](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband/issues/3) and
I hope that this post will serve as a starting point for some docs on setting
things up over there.

In order to generate reports using data from the Heroku app we'll need to:

1. Reset coverage data on each deploy so that the metrics reflect the latest deployed code.
2. Download baseline information about the application startup.
3. `git checkout` the same revision that has been deployed to heroku (or the stats won't match the code you have locally).
3. Connect to the remote redis instance and run `rake coverband:coverage` pointing to it.

To automate that process, I've [hacked together a couple rake tasks](https://github.com/fgrehm/legacy-blog-app/blob/master/lib/tasks/coverband.rake#L7)
to generate a report using production data and also to reset the remote stats
from my machine. It won't `git checkout` to the same revision that has been lastly
deployed to Heroku but at least it will give us an error when the code is out of
sync.

Here at HE:labs we use a gem we've created called [jumpup](https://github.com/Helabs/jumpup)
with its [heroku plugin](https://github.com/Helabs/jumpup-heroku) to automate the
integration process and making it clear the remote coverage stats during deployments
was just a matter of [adding the appropriate task to the list of integration tasks](https://github.com/fgrehm/legacy-blog-app/blob/master/lib/tasks/jumpup.rake#L10).
Given that it is just a rake task you can easily adapt it to your own deployment
process / scripts.

## Exercising the sample app and looking at the results

The app is pretty small, so after deploying the app to Heroku I did "everything"
that is possible to do through the UI, namely "[CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)"ing
blog posts and commenting on them.

The full report is available [here](http://fgrehm.github.io/legacy-blog-app/coverage)
and it is a pretty basic SimpleCov report that many people are familiar with.
Here's some things I found out when looking at the results.

### There's no magic

Fist of all, don't expect Coverband (or even [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov)
which is used under the hood) to be magical. For example, things that are evaluated within the
class body (like ActiveRecord validations) are always considered to be executed
and you'll need additional information in order to better understand what is
actually covered.

### Helpers

Unused helpers code are the easiest to identify. Helpers will be picked up on the
baseline data and unused methods will be easily spotted (unless you are doing some
badass meta programming black magic to define the methods of course):

![image](/blog/images/posts/2014-08-04/application_helper.png)

### Models

If you look at the codebase, there is no usage of the `Category` model on the app
apart from a `belongs_to` present on the `Post` that is [considered to be a hit](http://fgrehm.github.io/legacy-blog-app/coverage/#7d13cd61a520604a392cf16033346f089a4fef4a).
Unfortunately there is no easy way we can properly detect that the `Category` model
is not being used unless it have some additional logic. Simple models like that
will have its class body evaluated and will be considered to be 100% covered.
Some hints like additional methods the model might have or hooks (like the
stupid [before_save](https://github.com/fgrehm/legacy-blog-app/blob/master/app/models/category.rb#L4-L7)
I implemented) will be a good source of information as there is no way we can
create a `Category` from the UI.

One tricky issue I found was related to identifying dead scopes. One liners
like the one below will be considered as a hit by Coverband:

![image](/blog/images/posts/2014-08-04/inline_scope.png)

While scopes that spans multiple lines will be reported as not covered:

![image](/blog/images/posts/2014-08-04/multiline_scope.png)

I haven't checked if this is an issue with Coverband or SimpleCov but it is
something we need to keep in mind when looking at the results.

On a real world app, our models will have much more logic than what is present
on the sample app and besides the issues pointed out above I believe we can get
a lot of information about their usage with Coverband.

### Controllers

While models can be tricky to analyze, controllers are more straightforward
since they don't have much logic defined within the class body apart from
filters definition.

Dead actions are somewhat easy to spot but we still need to pay attention to
methods that have an empty body because Coverband / SimpleCov will consider
that it has no relevant lines and will mark them as covered:

![image](/blog/images/posts/2014-08-04/comment_show_action.png)

A good source of information on those cases are before and after filters since
that's likely to be where the empty action logic is implemented:

![image](/blog/images/posts/2014-08-04/before_filter.png)

### Views and partials

Views are a very special case because they are a mix of some template engine and
Ruby code. Coverband can't record it on the baseline results because it would
require it evaluate the template which in turn requires some controller logic
to work. Because of that the only way we can spot dead views is to make sure we
remove it alongside an unused controller action.

You'll also find some "weird" stuff like static HTML not being covered but you can
just ignore it:

![image](/blog/images/posts/2014-08-04/html_not_covered.png)

Partials can't be recorded on Coverband baseline results as well because they have
the same behavior as regular views. Unused partials will be hard to spot but a
good source of information are partials that are surrounded by an `if` block that
never gets entered like the one below:

![image](/blog/images/posts/2014-08-04/unused_partial.png)

_As Dan pointed out after a review of this post, to track unused views and partials
we can use [flatfoot](https://github.com/livingsocial/flatfoot)._

### Routes

To finish up this initial analysis, we've got the routes which are also hard to
identify dead code. Because they are declarative and the definition block is always
executed, you'll only be able to spot dead routes that have a block that spans
multiple lines associated with it:

![image](/blog/images/posts/2014-08-04/unused_route.png)

The same advice for views apply to routes, whenever you delete an action, make
sure you update the routes config as well.

## Conclusion

I'm a bit biased to say this but by looking at the reports I could easily spot
what the code I could safely remove from the sample app. I hope I can use it on
a real app on the future and come back to write a new post with the outcome of
that.

Keep in mind that having Coverband enabled will impact the performance of your
app. When using it, you'll probably want to have it enabled for a short period
of time or use a small sampling rate if you are willing to keep it enabled 100%
of the time. There is a [C extension](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband_ext)
on the works that [looks like will make things much faster](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband_ext#perf-improvements)
but I haven't tried it yet.

Hopefuly this post has given you a good start on what things you should look for
when analyzing the results but feel free to download the code to try things out
and let me know if you are able to identify other things we can look for.

If you used the gem in the past or if this post encouraged you to try out Coverband
on your app please leave a comment sharing your experience!
