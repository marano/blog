In november, 2013 I had the pleasure to do a talk on the Rupy Brazil 2013 on São José dos Campos/SP. I made some new friends and got together old friends.
I made a talk called [Model of the colossus](http://pt.slideshare.net/maurogeorge/model-of-the-colossus-2) where I gave some tips about how to clean up your Rails models. Here is the video with translation.
